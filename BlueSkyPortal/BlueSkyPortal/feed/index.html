		<h3>Executive summary</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Ontario North East Local Health Integration Network (NE-LHIN) is one of the largest of 14 LHINs in Ontario, responsible for planning, integrating and funding health care services for more than 565,000 people across 400,000 square Kilometers (Ministry of Health and LongTerm Care, 2015)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the past decade, NE-LHIN Long Term Care (LTC) Homes waiting list has grown exponentially as a result of significant progress towards improving the health of Ontarians, who are now living longer and with better access to a wide range of healthcare services(Patients first MOHLTC, 2015). According to Health Quality Ontario (2014); by 2030 seniors will number over 9.5 million and make up 23 percent of Canadians.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With a rapidly aging population, which means an increase in the number of people living with one or more chronic conditions and a growing need and demand for services provided in the LTC settings, NE-LHIN LTC Homes are facing drastic changes in their residents’ population needs in terms of more complex physical and behavioral care that demands special clinical skills workforce.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">NE-LHIN LTC homes are suffering from shortage of Personal Support Workers (PSW). With 30% of workforce above 50 years of age (Health Data Branch of the MOHLTC, 2012) and getting more physically demanding workload in the healthcare system (Health Quality Ontario 2016), NE-LHIN long term care homes are currently experiencing PSW shortage.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To meet the current and future Health Workforce needs of NE-LHIN LTC Homes the environmental scan highlighted that improvement measures are required within following themes: Training/Education; Promotion and Recruitment; Working conditions; and the Policy/Regulation environment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Environmental scanning identified two priority areas that are impacting directly PSW workforce supply: Total Compensation, and Collaboration and Innovation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A regional PSW Workforce Steering Committee needs to be established in comprised up of multiple partners – including frontline PSWs, public health care providers, service provider organizations, educational sector, employment organizations, advocacy agencies, and researchers to oversee the implementation of the plan.</p>

		<h3>Executive Summary</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Staffing shortage in pretty much all healthcare settings are pronounced especially licensed skilled workers such as nurses. The healthcare skilled worker gap is more than just job dissatisfaction and high turnover, the vacuum inevitably will jeopardize quality of care and healthcare of nation, which have unjustifiable impact as whole and life-threatening issues. The aim of this research is to identify the importance of the employees’ job satisfaction and make recommendations as how to increase the job satisfaction in healthcare workplaces. The research speaks to various factors influencing job satisfaction and its implication on the respected industry which is healthcare. Over and above studies and the research literatures, job satisfaction contributes to feeling fulfilled in everyday life.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Healthcare workplaces are physically and mentally demanding and are amongst the highest employee burnout occupations. Dealing with unruly patients, seeing sickness and death, long working hours and odd rotating schedules, physically demanding and biologically hazardous working conditions are just few factors that contribute to implication of healthcare workplaces on job satisfaction (Heinrich 2019). High turnover is the primary symptoms of unhappy employees. It goes without saying that more satisfied employees’ tent to dedicate their commitment to employers’ whose staff satisfaction is their top priority (Chiu et al. 2005).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This research was restricted to a sector specific workplace, healthcare. The study has used the job satisfaction data collected from acute care facilities. The data is collected through paper, mobile and online surveys, face-to-face and phone interviews, online polls and longitudinal studies. The presented collected data in this research was compiled to develop a group then through disassembling the data was reduced and excluded invariant themes of occurrence. Province wide research was conducted in Quebec Canada by the Institute de recherché Robert-Sauvé en santé et en sécurité du travail (IRSST) research team about work environment impact on nurses’ job satisfaction and wellbeing in 2012.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Analyzed data of first sample group has identified the top four influencers on job satisfaction ranking from high to low: 1) staff shortage 2) emotional demand 3) recognition 4) physical unit layout. Further the second survey was conducted with registered nurses as well as registed practical nurses in total of 13,668 to highlight the motivational and environmental indicators that nurses perceive to impact their job satisfaction. The result of this research is very similar to previous studies. Job satisfaction and its influencers in healthcare and specifically nurses have been the research topic of many scholars in past two decades due to noticeable increase workforce challenges and staff shortage.</p>

		<p style="text-align: justify;">The secret in manifesting your dream to reality is believing the fact that you are gifted with ultimate force of life. Within you, there is the mighty power beyond all the energy ever existed. Within you there is a highest form of energy that does not represent the Supreme power, it is the deity itself. Your body is only the canvas that forms its artist’s expression. Just like all the artists who express their emotion through their arts by creating out of mastering the limitations. Human body is the masterpiece of all creation in three-dimensional reality. Michelangelo&#8217;s Sistine Chapel is just a magnificent story to a blind person. Mozart&#8217;s Exsultate Jubilate is merely an imagination to a deaf person who can read music. Rumi&#8217;s poems are just beautiful lyrics to those who are not in love. Human was kicked out of heaven to get ready for the next life’s rebirth to those who did not discover the god’s art and had to come up with the story to justify their misery born out of Mediocracy. The true gift of life is the consciousness. The magnificent art as pure as the creator of all existence. The entity in form of matter yet heavenly as God. Just like any other art that is displayed at its optimized limitation, consciousness is not exempted either. Davinci created Mona Lisa with limited colour that human eye can see, same with limited notes in any music’s masterpiece. As well as the limitation with any language that poet can write. The consciousness is limited to time and space. That is the fact of three-dimensional reality. Meaning since it forms in terms of matter, therefore, takes space so rightfully so is bonded to time. However, if you recall, I claimed this masterpiece is as heavenly as God, so how could we tap into its unlimited power? If the time and space are the only limitations of consciousness; optimizing the consciousness means collapsing the time and space. Do not get too crazy, you cannot get rid of the time and space all at once unless you are not in form of matter. The key is elevating your vibration from matter to quantum. By raising your energy from the state of survival to exploring the possibilities; predicting your future by creating it out of unknown. Facing your fears head-on and overcoming your limited believes that weigh down your creativity like shackles. Everything in form of existence vibrates, hence creates a frequency. Higher vibration leads to elevated frequency, meaning more energy. Operating your analytical mind in low Beta and maintaining your elevated heartfelt emotion while having a clear intention is the secret strategy to ascend. In other word, forget about levitating if you are experiencing, Shame, Guilt, Apathy, Grief, Fear, Jealousy, Anger, Hate, Possessiveness, etc. By becoming nobody, you will experience the state of nothingness. By raising your vibration to level of nothingness you become no-one and then gradually to everyone. Only in that state of mind, you experience the absolute oneness that unifies the realm of polarity, which the two ends come together collapsing space and dissolving time. By tapping into pure consciousness, you embrace the ultimate possibilities of unified field. The ultimate possibility of the unified field is the Genie in the oil lamp, and you become the Aladdin by maintaining clear intention and elevated heart felt emotion. As I promised; manifest your dream to reality. Sky is the limit dream like a child, live like Aladdin. By mastering the inner game, you conquered the game of life.</p>
